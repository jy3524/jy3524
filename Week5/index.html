            <li class="text">Rafael is a New York-based, Dutch-Brazillian visual artist whose works range from virtual experiences to physical creations.<br>
            <br>Despite their wide-ranging variety of forms, his pieces all have one thing in common: that they stem from his fascination with moving images and the concept of interactivity.<br>
            <br>He is also known for being one of the first artists to sell a website as an artwork after selling the domain containing his web-based pieces to art collectors and adding their names to the source code.</li>
